# Learning Path

## Mastering Components & Directives

Component Lifecycle Hooks:
Learn about hooks to manage component initialization, updates, and teardown.

Hooks:

- [ ] ngOnInit
- [ ] ngOnChanges
- [ ]  ngAfterViewInit
- [ ]  etc.

Other Built-in Directives:
Expand your knowledge beyond ngClass by working with:

- [ ] ngIf & ngFor: For conditional rendering and  looping.
- [ ] ngStyle: For dynamic styling.
- [ ] Custom Directives: Create your own attribute or structural directives to encapsulate behavior.

## Dependency Injection & Services

- [ ] Services & DI:

Understand how Angular’s Dependency Injection works by creating and injecting services. This is crucial for sharing data and logic across components.

- [ ] Singleton vs. Scoped Services:

Learn how to provide services in different modules and how to control their scope.


## More on Routing & Navigation

- [ ] Router Module

Set up routing to navigate between views. Learn to define routes, use routerLink, and handle route parameters.

- [ ] Route Guards

Explore how to protect routes with guards like CanActivate, CanDeactivate, and Resolve.

## Forms & User Input

- [ ] Template-Driven vs. Reactive Forms

Dive into Angular forms to handle user input:
Reactive Forms: Offers more control with FormGroup, FormControl, and custom validators.
Template-Driven Forms: Simpler for small forms, leveraging two-way data binding.

## Observables & RxJS (Complementary to Signals)

- [ ] Observables:
While Angular signals provide a modern reactivity model, RxJS observables are still widely used in Angular for handling asynchronous operations like HTTP requests.

- [ ] Operators & Subscriptions:
Get familiar with operators like map, filter, switchMap and managing subscriptions effectively.

## HTTP & API Integration

- [ ] HttpClient Module:
Learn to integrate with back-end services using Angular’s HttpClient. Understand how to perform GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests and handle errors gracefully.

## Testing Angular Applications

- [ ] Unit Testing:
Learn how to test components, services, and directives using Jasmine and Karma.

- [ ] End-to-End Testing
Explore tools like Protractor or Cypress to perform E2E tests
